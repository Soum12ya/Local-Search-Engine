🔎 Local Search & Ranking Engine

This project is a highly performant, custom-built search engine prototype developed in Python. It demonstrates foundational Computer Science concepts, including Information Retrieval (IR) algorithms, advanced data structures (Trie, Inverted Index), and modern full-stack integration (Python/Flask/AJAX).

🚀 Project Goal & Technical Focus

The primary goal of this project was to move beyond simple CRUD applications and build a system that solves a complex, core engineering problem: efficiently retrieving and ranking relevant information.
